# What is Okra ?
Okra is an open source, free and multi-plateform tool for teams and individual willing to friendly track their OKR: Objectives and Key Results. If you want to learn more about OKR you can have a look at that [https://github.com/domenicosolazzo/awesome-okr](awesome git repo). There is already a bunch of tools to manage OKR but they all come with a price and tend to be difficult to use for small team.

# As spicy as...
Did you know Okra is an edible flower fruit. It has a nutty texture and a delicate flavor, but it can taste a lot like whatever you want it to be combined. And it is a popular health food due to its high fiber, vitamin C, and folate content. Okra is also known for being high in antioxidants plus a good source of calcium and potassium.

It the same for our tool, we want to provide to you an app flexible and compatible with your needs. For free. We don't sell your data and respect your private life. You can mix Okra with your phone to make it portable, or use it at work on a website to be effecient. Make Okra as spicy as your life!
