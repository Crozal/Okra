# What is Okra ?
Okra is an open source, free and multi-plateform tool for teams and individual willing to friendly track their OKR: Objectives and Key Results. If you want to learn more about OKR you can have a look at that [awesome git repo](https://github.com/domenicosolazzo/awesome-okr). There is already a bunch of tools to manage OKR but they all come with a price and tend to be difficult to use for small team.

The aim of Okra is to help people managing their own time with more effeciency connecting with each other, still freely. This tool is first designed for the Mozillian community. You can discussed the development here: [Mozilla Discourse Topic](https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/okra-managing-objectives-and-key-results/8806).


# As spicy as...
Did you know Okra is an edible flower fruit. It has a nutty texture and a delicate flavor, but it can taste a lot like whatever you want it to be combined. And it is a popular health food due to its high fiber, vitamin C, and folate content. Okra is also known for being high in antioxidants plus a good source of calcium and potassium.

It's the same for this tool, we want to provide to you an app flexible and compatible with your needs. For free. We don't sell your data and respect your private life. You can mix Okra with your phone to make it portable, or use it at work on a website to be effecient. Make Okra as spicy as your life!


# Okra a web-app
The development of Okra is now being discussed at Mozilla community Discourse. You can see the live mockup [here](http://popzelife.me/okra.html) - still an alpha version.

Okra is for now being developped as a web-app, its framework relies on a PHP server that hosts the users informations, along with a web page being the user-interface. The language being used are HTML 5 and CSS 3 for sure, plus PHP and Javascript (Jquery with Ajax).

There are currently four branches:

- html-public: the framework for the user-interface (the web page)
- sql-setting: adding the database with its tables
- php-classes: the upcoming classes to interact between the server and the web page
- mockup: web app mockup for a live preview


# Mozilla API
The Mozillians and Reps portal are in Python and Django. For now, not being considered as my skills in Django are too basic.
